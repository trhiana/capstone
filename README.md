# capstone

This repository contains the code I worked with as part of my final year capstone project. <br/>

The focus of my project was to test proposed federated learning algorithms using different parameters like other datasets to better understand how they respond in these different scenarios. <br/>

Two algorithms were the focus of this research and they are:
- an algorithm that uses federated learning to detect malware in IoT devices (fed_iot_guard).
- an algorithm that uses segmented federated learnin for intrusion detection in large scale multiple LANs (segmented-FL). <br/>

The goal of this research was not to create a new algorithm but to test what has already been created using different parameters. 

## Testing environment
### Technologies used
- Python
- PyCharm
- Google Colab
- Jupyter Notebook

### Hardware setup
- Ubuntu 22.04
- 1 TB HDD

## Execution
### fed_iot_guard
The commands I used to test this algorithm can be found in the fed_iot_guardTest.ipynb file. More information on the parameters used is provided by the authors in the README.md file in the folder.

### segmented-FL
The file can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HqimQWBzo1kIybMCbieYrjrULA5IFCpe/view?usp=sharing).
As stated by the author, running this algorithm can be done using
```
python main.py
```
or 
```
python3 main.py
```
The statement used depends on the operating system you have.

## Acknowledgements
I am grateful to my my supervisor, Dr. Justice Appati, for his continued patience and support during this project.
