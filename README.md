# capstone

This repository contains the code I worked with as part of my final year capstone project. 
The focus of my project was to test proposed federated learning algorithms using different parameters like other datasets to better understand how they respond in these different scenarios. 
Two algorithms were the focus of this research and they are:
- a proposed algorithm that uses federated learning to detect malware in IoT devices (fed_iot_guard).
-
