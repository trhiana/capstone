# capstone

This repository contains the code I worked with as part of my final year capstone project. 
The focus of my project was to test proposed federated learning algorithms using different parameters like other datasets to better understand how they respond in these different scenarios. 
Two algorithms were the focus of this research and they are:
- an algorithm that uses federated learning to detect malware in IoT devices (fed_iot_guard).
- an algorithm that uses segmented federated learnin for intrusion detection in large scale multiple LANs (segmented-FL). 
The goal of this research was not to create a new algorithm but to test what has already been created using different parameters. 

## Testing environment
